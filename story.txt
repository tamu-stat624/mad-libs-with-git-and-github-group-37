Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear [Rahul],


I am writing to you from a [Huge] spaceship in a [Nasty] galaxy.I found myself here one day after going for a ride on a Maroon rocket in September. There are 56 [Pens] and [Groups] of [Person] here! In the
[Kitchen] there is a pool full of [Beer]. I fall asleep each night on a [delicious] bed of
[carbon fiber] and dream of [Exercising] [fast]. It feels as though I have lived here for
[7] [seconds]. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
[eating] on a [tiny] [ship]!!

Best wishes,
[Sarthak]
